Special Forces soldier. A professional! I will do all that my nation requires of 
me.<br>I am a volunteer, knowing well the hazards of my profession.<br>I serve with the 
memory of those who have gone before me. I pledge to uphold the honor and 
integrity of all I am - in all I do.<br>I am a professional 
soldier. I will teach and fight wherever my nation requires. I will strive 
always, to excel in every art and artifice of war.<br>I know that I will 
be called upon to perform tasks in isolation, far from familiar faces and 
voices, with the help and guidance of my God.<br>I will keep my mind 
and body clean, alert and strong, for this is my debt to those who depend upon 
me.<br>I will not fail 
those with whom I serve. I will not bring shame upon myself or the forces.<br>I will maintain 
myself, my arms, and my equipment in an immaculate state as befits a Special 
Forces soldier.<br>I will never 
surrender though I be the last. If I am taken, I pray that I may have the 
strength to spit upon my enemy.<br>My goal is to 
succeed in any mission - and live to succeed again. <br>I am a member of my 
squad's chosen soldiery. God grant that I may not be found wanting, that I will 
not fail this sacred trust.</font></b></p>
